These codes were writen in PyCharm 2016.3.2 using Python 3.6

This project is writen for course Statiscal Leanrning opened in USTC by Dong Liu.

There are four .py files in this project
1. 'util.py' contains some functions we defined
2. 'linear_regression.py' can perform linear classification using:
    a. ridge regression
    b. Lasso regression
    c. Fisher's LDA
3. 'logistic_regression.py' can perform linear classification, and its solution
    can be obtained using:
    a. maximum likelihood
    b. Newton-Raphson
4. 'multi_class_classification.py' perform multi-class classification

Run the corresponding files according to what you want. And some slight and easy
    changes need to be made if you want to show the results presented in the report.
