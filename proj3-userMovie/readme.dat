These codes were written in PyCharm 2017.3.3 using Python 3.6

This project is writen for course Statiscal Leanrning opened in USTC by Dong Liu.

There are three .py files in this project
1. 'util.py' contains some functions we defined
2. 'task1_naive_bayes.py' can predict the gender and age of users according to their
    movie ratings using cross validation. For each fold, error rates of prediction
    of gender and age are calculated, and the runtime of training and test are also
    obtained. Both error rate and runtime are saved in the directory '.\cache\'.
3. 'show_results.py' can visualize the results.

You can use this project as follows:
1. run 'task1_naive_bayes.py' first to obtain required results, and
2. run 'show_results.py'
   to show results.
