These codes were written in PyCharm 2017.3.3 using Python 2.7

This project is written for course Statiscal Leanrning opened in USTC by Dong Liu.

There are three .py files in this project
1. 'util.py' contains some functions we defined
2. 'project4.py' can extract deep features from the data and perform image retrieval
3. 'show_reslts.py' can visualize the results

You can use this project as follows:
1. run 'project4.py' first to obtain required results, and
2. run 'show_results.py' to show the results
